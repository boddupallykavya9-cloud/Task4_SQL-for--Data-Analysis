# Data Analyst Internship SQL Task

## Overview

This repository contains solutions for the Data Analyst Internship Task involving SQL-based data analysis on an E-commerce sample database. All queries were developed and tested using MySQL Workbench and focus on core SQL operations commonly required in business data analytics roles.

## Objectives Covered

*   Data selection, filtering, sorting: `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
*   Relational analysis using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
*   Data summarization via aggregate functions: `SUM`, `AVG`
*   Use of subqueries and `HAVING` for advanced filtering
*   Creation of reusable database views
*   Exporting query results as needed

## Contents

*   `first-1.sql` â€” Contains all assignment queries, each clearly commented and sectioned by topic.
*   Screenshots of task description and optional output (where provided).
## Instructions

To reproduce results:

1.  Import the "Ecommerce" SQL database into MySQL.
2.  Open and run the queries in `first-1.sql` in MySQL Workbench.
3.  For specific resultsets, right-click the output grid and select "Export" to save as CSV or Excel.

The code includes examples for all assignment requirements.

## Sections in the SQL File:

*   Table exploration and field checks
*   Data filtering (`SELECT + WHERE`)
*   Sorting and grouping
*   `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` joins
*   Aggregate calculations and group analysis
*   Subquery use
*   Creating views for frequent analysis

## Notes

*   All table and column names were verified using `DESCRIBE` before use.
*   The dataset structure assumed is consistent with standard open-source ecommerce schemas.
*   Queries are commented for clarity and to aid reviewers in navigation.
